In the [previous part](/series/async-await/understanding-async-and-await/), we learned how `async`/`await` lets code pause and resume without losing its place. This part answers *why it matters*: because waiting burns your most precious resource—threads. Async/await turns that dead time into space the system can reuse.

## Time is the bottleneck, not the CPU

Think of a small kitchen at dinner rush. One pot is boiling, another tray is in the oven. If the cook stands there staring at the timer, no one is chopping, plating, or greeting guests. Nothing cooks faster, yet everything finishes later. That's blocking on I/O.

Software used to treat *waiting* as work. A thread would block on the network or disk, holding memory and a stack frame, doing nothing while counting the seconds. In a desktop app, that freezes the UI. In a server, that caps throughput long before the CPU is the limiting factor.

## The shift: cooperative time-sharing for I/O

Async/await is not about going faster; it's about *not hogging the thread while you wait*. When an awaited I/O starts, the method yields. The thread goes back to the pool (or UI loop) to serve other work. When the result arrives, the continuation resumes exactly where it paused.

Under the hood, the compiler rewrites your method into a state machine. Continuations are scheduled via the captured synchronization context (UI) or the thread pool (ASP.NET Core). The result is cooperative time-sharing:

* **I/O-bound work**: frees threads during waits, dramatically improving *throughput*.
* **UI-bound work**: keeps the message loop free, preserving *responsiveness*.
* **Library code**: exposes both async APIs and (optionally) separate sync APIs without forcing callers into blocking shims.

## What changes in practice

### Web APIs (throughput)

A thread-per-request server blocks during I/O (database, HTTP, storage). With async handlers, the same thread can serve another request while the first one awaits results. That means higher RPS with the same thread budget and steadier latency under load.

```csharp
// Before: synchronous action (blocks the thread during I/O)
public IActionResult GetOrder(int id)
{
    var json = new WebClient().DownloadString($"https://example.com/orders/{id}"); // blocks
    var order = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Order>(json);
    return Ok(order);
}

// After: asynchronous action (yields during I/O)
public async Task<IActionResult> GetOrder(int id)
{
    using var http = new HttpClient();
    var res  = await http.GetAsync($"https://example.com/orders/{id}");
    var body = await res.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    var order = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Order>(body);
    return Ok(order);
}
```

{: .note }
 In real apps, reuse `HttpClient` (e.g., via `IHttpClientFactory`) rather than creating a new instance per request.

### Desktop & mobile (responsiveness)

UI frameworks marshal updates onto a single UI thread. Any blocking call on that thread starves input, painting, and animations. Await keeps the loop breathing.

```csharp
// Bad: blocks the UI thread until the file is read
var text = File.ReadAllText(path); // freezes animations & input

// Good: yields while the OS reads
var text = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(path);
SomeLabel.Text = text;
```

## The anti-pattern you feel too early: `.Result` / `.Wait()`

Blocking on a `Task` defeats the entire purpose and can deadlock when a continuation needs the blocked context.

```csharp
// Blocks the thread; on a context-bound thread (like UI), this can deadlock
var data = FetchAsync().Result; 

// Better: make the caller async too (async-all-the-way)
var data = await FetchAsync();
```

**Guidelines:**

* Prefer async-all-the-way to the top boundary (controller action, event handler, or console `Main`).
* If you must bridge sync↔async, isolate it at the *edge* on a thread-pool thread and avoid context capture.

```csharp
// Sync facade at the boundary — do NOT sprinkle this everywhere
public static T RunSync<T>(Func<Task<T>> asyncOp) =>
    Task.Run(async () => await asyncOp().ConfigureAwait(false)).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
```

* In libraries, use `ConfigureAwait(false)` to avoid capturing a context you don't own.
* For console apps, prefer `static async Task Main(string[] args)` to avoid sync-over-async.
* Avoid `Task.Run` as a scalability crutch on ASP.NET Core hot paths; use it only for truly CPU-bound work.

## Mental model: bookmarks in time

Each `await` is a bookmark. The method pauses; the thread doesn’t. The continuation resumes later with the same locals and control flow, minus the wasted waiting. That’s the entire why:

* **Same readability**, because your code still looks sequential.
* **Higher throughput**, because threads aren’t chained to I/O.
* **Better UX**, because the UI keeps pumping messages.

Async/await didn’t make I/O faster. It made waiting *cheap*.

In the [next part](/series/async-await/timing-vs-teamwork/), we’ll separate *asynchronous* (timing) from *parallel* (teamwork) and show how they interplay in real systems.
