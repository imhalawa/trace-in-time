## Asynchronous vs Parallel Programming

In the [previous part](/series/async-await/why-async-await-change-everything/), we learned how `async` and `await` transform waiting into progress—how code keeps working even when time stands still. But not all waiting is created equal. Sometimes, you're not waiting for something external like an API call or a file read; you're waiting on pure computation—your own code crunching numbers. That's where timing meets teamwork.

In our kitchen metaphor, asynchronous work is about **timing** — the cook steps aside while the oven works. Parallel work is about **teamwork** — several cooks chopping vegetables together. Both create progress, but in different ways.

**Asynchronous programming** handles **I/O-bound operations** — tasks that spend most of their life waiting for something outside the CPU: network responses, file systems, or databases. The challenge isn’t speed, it’s patience. By using `async` and `await`, you let the system pause intelligently, freeing threads to handle other work until the external operation finishes.

**Parallel programming**, on the other hand, handles **CPU-bound operations** — heavy, calculation-intensive tasks like image processing, data analysis, or encryption. These keep the processor busy. The trick here is to divide the work so that multiple cores share the load, finishing the job faster.

```csharp
// Asynchronous I/O: the thread is free while waiting
using var http = new HttpClient();
var json = await http.GetStringAsync("https://example.com/data");

// Parallel CPU work: divide a heavy workload across cores
Parallel.For(0, 3, i => DoCpuBoundWork(i));
```

Both patterns often use tasks and the **Task Parallel Library (TPL)**. For asynchronous I/O, the OS signals completion and your continuation is scheduled (on a synchronization context or the thread pool). For parallelism, multiple threads/cores execute work concurrently. The difference in purpose: asynchronous I/O improves responsiveness and scalability by not blocking threads; parallelism improves CPU utilization and reduces per‑job latency for CPU‑bound work.

Use `Task.Run(...)` to offload CPU‑bound work to the thread pool when you need to keep a UI thread responsive or avoid blocking a request thread. Avoid wrapping I/O in `Task.Run`; prefer true async I/O APIs instead.

In real-world systems you’ll often combine them. A web API might concurrently fetch data from multiple services with `Task.WhenAll`, then process the combined result in parallel before sending the response. Like a kitchen where the cook waits for the oven, then calls two assistants to plate the dishes.

Understanding when to use each approach keeps your systems smooth and scalable. `async` and `await` manage the waiting. Parallelism manages the work. Together, they turn software into an orchestra of timing and teamwork.

In the [`next part`](/series/async-await/continuation-and-context/), we’ll look at what happens after an `await` — how code knows where to resume, and why context matters when your program comes back to life.
