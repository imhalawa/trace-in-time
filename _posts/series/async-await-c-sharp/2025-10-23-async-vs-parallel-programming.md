In the [`previous part`](/series/async-await/why-async-await-change-everything/), we learned how `async` and `await` transform waiting into progress — how code keeps working even when time stands still. But not all waiting is created equal. Sometimes, you’re not waiting for something *external* like an API call or a file read; you’re waiting on pure computation — your own code crunching numbers. That’s where timing meets teamwork.

In our kitchen metaphor, asynchronous work is about **timing** — the cook steps aside while the oven works. Parallel work is about **teamwork** — several cooks chopping vegetables together. Both create progress, but in different ways.

**Asynchronous programming** handles **I/O-bound operations** — tasks that spend most of their life waiting for something outside the CPU: network responses, file systems, or databases. The challenge isn’t speed, it’s patience. By using `async` and `await`, you let the system pause intelligently, freeing threads to handle other work until the external operation finishes.

**Parallel programming**, on the other hand, handles **CPU-bound operations** — heavy, calculation-intensive tasks like image processing, data analysis, or encryption. These keep the processor busy. The trick here is to divide the work so that multiple cores share the load, finishing the job faster.

```csharp
// Asynchronous: waiting for external resources
await Task.Run(() =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Loading data from the network...");
});

// Parallel: dividing a heavy workload
Parallel.Invoke(
    () => Console.WriteLine("Processing batch 1"),
    () => Console.WriteLine("Processing batch 2"),
    () => Console.WriteLine("Processing batch 3")
);
```

Both patterns rely on the same foundation — the **Task Parallel Library (TPL)**. It’s the manager behind the scenes, deciding which tasks run, when they pause, and how threads are reused. The difference is in purpose: asynchronous code optimizes *latency*; parallel code optimizes *throughput*.

When you use `await Task.Run(...)`, you’re asking for asynchronous work that can run in parallel — a blend of both worlds. This hybrid approach makes sense when a background computation must complete without blocking the main thread.

In real-world systems, you’ll often combine them. A web API might fetch data asynchronously, then process it in parallel before sending the response. Like a kitchen where the cook waits for the oven, then calls two assistants to plate the dishes.

Understanding when to use each approach keeps your systems smooth and scalable. `async` and `await` manage the waiting. Parallelism manages the work. Together, they turn software into an orchestra of timing and teamwork.

In the [`next part`](/series/async-await/continuation-and-context/), we’ll look at what happens after an `await` — how code knows where to resume, and why context matters when your program comes back to life.
