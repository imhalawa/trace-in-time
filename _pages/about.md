I’m Mohamed Halawa — a backend software engineer who sees software as a form of art, and code as the way I draw. Every system I build begins as a question — how to make something clear, elegant, and alive. I work where logic meets intuition, shaping order from complexity until it feels effortless.

Code is language, but it’s also rhythm and texture — a medium for expressing how things should connect. Photography and writing carry that same impulse: to pause, to observe, and to translate thought into form.

*Trace in Time* is where those expressions converge — the things I build, the ideas I chase, and the fragments I don’t want to lose. It’s less a portfolio and more a journal of progress: an archive of patterns, both digital and human.

Outside of work, I tend to observe — light, systems, movement, people. Everything leaves a trace, and the act of noticing is what makes it meaningful.

If what you read here slows you down, makes you curious, or gives you a clearer way to see — then it’s done what it should.
